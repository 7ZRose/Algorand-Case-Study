# Algorand-Case-Study

## Overview and Origin

- Algorand Inc.
- Founded in 2017
- Founder - Silvio Micali

- The idea for Algorand came about in 2015 when its founder Silvio Micali began researching blockchain technology as well as Bitcoin. He noticed the cryptocurrency had some shortcomings that he could improve. He decided to move forward with his own version of a permissionless blockchain on the web.

- After running test simulations of up to 500,000 users simultaniously - they were able to achieve satisfactory results. This prompted Silvio to form the company **Algorand Inc** and **The Algorand Foundation** based on his version of a *Borderless Economy*. [title](https://community.algorand.org/blog/algorand-origins/)

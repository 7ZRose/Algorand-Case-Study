# Algorand-Case-Study

## Overview and Origin

- Algorand Inc. (or Algo)
- Founded in 2017
- Founder - Silvio Micali

- The idea for Algorand came about in 2015 when its founder Silvio Micali began researching blockchain technology as well as Bitcoin. He noticed the cryptocurrency had some shortcomings that he could improve. He decided to move forward with his own version of a permissionless blockchain on the web.

- After running test simulations of up to 500,000 users simultaniously - they were able to achieve satisfactory results. This prompted Silvio to form the company **Algorand Inc** and **The Algorand Foundation** based on his version of a *Borderless Economy*.

- The company recieved **$4 million** in seed funds in February of 2018 from VC firms Pillar and Union Square Ventures. Later in the year they recieved an accumulated **$62 million** from various other investors. They immediately appointed Steve Kokinos as CEO and Sean Ford as COO making a statement that they want to hire people *who can help scale their business*.

## Business Activities

- Since it's inception, Algorand has been aimed towards creating a truly secured, decentralized and scalable blockchain. They have executed this exceptionally thus far. In regards to smart contracts; compared to competitors Algo has created a seemingly perfect blockchain ecosystem. They've been able to eliminate high gas fees and longer transaction speeds. 

- They have created a very popular API - the *MyAlgo Wallet* is very easy to use compared to some of the competitors along with an awesome features including a governance system in place for people looking to stake their coins for a reasonably high APY as well as a community voting system that will guide the project further based on it's users' preferences.

- The biggest problem facing Algo at the moment would probably be staying ahead, or at least up to speed in the rapidly evolving battlefield of cryptocurrency. There are many companies gunning for the top spot in this realm. The trend has so far been as such; not progressing with current trends and/or implementing newer tech leaves you in the dust.

- Another issue at hand - not directly from the company itself, but with one of it's partnered main hubs - is cyber security. The main trading platform [TinyMan](app.tinyman.org) was hacked into in early 2022 and millions of dollars were stolen from some of it's top performing projects within the Algorand network. As a result they had to shut down their service for a couple of weeks to figure out the vulnerability. Moving forward, trust will be a big factor in this company's success and others like it.

- The company has a slew of potential customers and investors, ranging from everyday crypto traders buying coins on Coinbase to people who want to store information securely within a blockchain. 27 million people (or 8.3%) of Americans now own crypto - it is now estimated that over 114 million people globally hold crypto. These are all potential customers for Algo.

- It is estimated that already over 10 million people are current Algorand holders.

- Algo has many enticing technological features that could attract a wide base including; **Atomic Transfers** in Layer-1 (for secure transfers), the **Algorand Virtual Machine** tech (which is a powerful tool used for building smart contracts) and **Rekeying in Layer-1**.

- They are utilizing the newest, fastest and most secure tech available right now. Their team created a *proof-of-stake* protocol, which is probably the most enticing trait of the project. It's not only a cheaper method of solving blocks on the blockchain (because it requires no expensive mining equipment) it is also more powerful than predecessors because it can generate even more because miners are pooling their resources. It is also faster than the competition - as opposed to taking 10 minutes to propogate a block into the network, Algo can propogate in seconds.

## Landscape

- Algorand is a blockchain ecosystem backed by a crypto currency of the same name. It would be categorized in the *alternate finance* domain of the financial industry.

- Major milestones for Algo over the past few years include the following:
 - In April of 2019 they released the public testnet.
 - In June of 2019 they went live and officially launched
 - In November of 2019 they released their first major update which included ASA (*Algorand Standard Asset*), Atomics Assets and Algorand Smart Contracts (all heavily implementing Layer-1).
 - In 2020 the community devs created and released [TinyMan](app.tinyman.org) and [TinyCharts](tinycharts.org) - the current popular trading API and chart index respectively.

- Since they have been tweaking their project and as the community behind Algo continues to build they have made great strides to be one of the most high-functioning systems out there. While the applications associated with Algo are still in their infantile states they are still able to draw some decent numbers and continue to grow day in and day out. With more money pouring into the developers of these applications, updates and new features are being added quite regularly to improve functionality.

- A cool feature that seems to exist exclusively in the TinyMan world is being able to opt-in to recieve tokens otherwise lost due to slippage post-transaction. For no fee you can have the tokens you would have lost elsewhere back into your wallet - as opposed to Uniswap or Binance - who just keep that slippage loss for themselves.

- The other big players that are comparable to Algorand in the crypto-world for smart contracts would inclkude **Ethereum**, **Cardano**, **Binance**, and **Solana** among some others.

- The competitors as far as blockchain technology go would include companies like **Qtum**, **NEO**, **Stratis Group**, and **Neblio**.

## Results

- Algorand has seemingly imprinted itself within the industry as setting the standard for what it means to be a sustainable blockchain. They have also made it apparent that you don't need to leave a huge carbon footprint - being that they are the *greenest blockchain*.

- The real results of this will make themself evident in time, but being that this is a fairly new company and concept all together, we haven't seem too much of a grasp of what the potential of Algo actually is yet.

- The core metrics of how a project like this is standing up right now is mostly in the numbers. Compared to the market cap of similar projects it would seem that either Algorand is either underperforming or my personal belief that they just haven't had their day to shine yet. Only time will tell.

### The Numbers

- Algorand MC - $6.6 billion
- Ethereum MC - ~$360 billion
- Binance/Binance Smart Chain MC - $67.9 billion
- Solana MC - $35.7 billion
- Cardano MC - $37.3 billion

## Recomendations

- One thing I would reccomend to Algorand would be to simplify things a bit for the average consumer who doesn't necessarily understand blockchain fully. I understand that as a tech company you need to look polished and sharp but I feel if they took a proactive attempt at getting into the heads of the general public and dumbing it down a bit, that they could moon a little bit harder. **Ethereum** didn't need to do this - being that it was the first of it's kind. **Binance** did exactly this - allowed for people to buy and sell things on it's biggest trading platform **Pancakeswap**. This enticed degen traders to the point that they solidified themselves as number 2 in the realm. To be fair, I believe this is what they are trying to do at the moment - TinyMan is a fantastic application (with the exception of the forementioned cyber attack) with cute logos and some great features. With some time and work that app could really make Algorand take off. Until recently Algo didn't have a mainstream feel to it and lacked funtionality. Hopefully with all these recent releases people will see the benefits of holding and using it.

- Algorand could greatly benefit from having a partner or child project launch on the network that has enough initial liquidity to draw attention. If they took even just a few million dollars and invested it into a utlity token (different from the leading utility token **Yieldly**) it could really push them forward. What they are lacking right now within the blockchain are projects that have any real purpose other than being a memecoin. The Algorand foundation has begun giving out grants to help fund projects with utility as an incentive to build on this platform but we are still a ways away from seeing the results of that (hopefully by the end of the year).

- This could be a great thing for them if these utility tokens could make enough noise to pull people away from the ETH and BNB network and bring some of that money into ALGO. Being that only one or two projects within the Algorand network have been able to do this - it is something that gives the competition has a real edge.

- Being that Algorand has it's own coding language (TEAL) not a lot of people know how to develop projects on it yet - I believe if they made a push into educational videos or programs to get people on board with it could really help broaden the horizon. I haven't even seen a project on there with any kind of tokenomics yet or tax system in place. I believe this is just because the basic current developers and coders haven't figured out how to implement them yet.

- Implementing incentives to bring more developers with higher tech IQ's would be invaluable to Algo. A lot of the crypto-hype starts with word-of-mouth. If so-and-so from a successful project on the ETH network reaches out to their community and says "I'm gonna be launching my next project on Algorand" it will bring a lot of new faces. The incentives to do so just aren't there yet - they haven't cracked the code that the rest of these platforms have. They need to learn how to ride the waves of these bull-cycles yet. 

- Instead of saying that this company needs better tech - I will say that I think this company needs to get a broader audience. And to do so they will need to bring in some voices that people are listening to. They are making steady growth but have yet to really break into the smart contract game - which as we've seen over the past couple of years is a hugely impactful source of getting money flooding into your network.

- I know that the Algorand Foundation has funneled some money into TinyCharts, but that application needs a massive facelift. If you look at the competitor [DexTools](dextools.io), you can see a massive differentiation between the two. TinyCharts almost looks like a website built in the mid 2000's. It doesn't give the user many options or all the information one would like to see - such as live trading, being able to see trading history and it's filter system to look through projects. The enabled an extremely primative popularity rating system. For instance if you open up 100 tabs on your browser and copy/paste the link to a particular coin, it will automatically make your coin one of the trending projects on the platform - even if your computer is the only one looking at it. It makes for easy manipulation and can be very misleading to the average consumer. These types of issues make it hard to trust what you are looking at. DexTools has a similar system in place but it is way harder to manipulate because they have millions of users on there at a time. That being said - DexTools **still can be** manipulated - people often pay someone to break their projects into the top 10. I'm not sure the process behind this, but it does happen every day and is an issue across the whole industry.

- Once Algorand has been up and running for a few years I'm sure they will have done all forementioned things - they are still in a building period and are accumulating bigger numbers and higher volume daily. As long as they continue to let the community guide the project in the direction they want it to go I think they will flourish.
